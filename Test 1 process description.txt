-----Test 1-----

* The programming language used is Javascript (NodeJS)

* Specified the entry path for the files

* Merged the files (also specifying a location for the merged files)

* Specified the result path (where the resulting table would be)

* Created a method to convert the files into JSON format
	> Structured the data by using the document pattern to identify each fied in the table
	> Operated on the data
	> Created a JSON containing the data

//* Created a module to convert JSON to CSV (used an external module internally):
//	> It was customized to specifically to accomodate the application
//	> The idea was to make it reusable

* Used the module to convert the resuting JSON data created earlier to CSV file (so the result is a CSV table)
