-----Test 2-----

* The programming language used is Javascript (NodeJS)

* Specified the entry path for the files

* Created hepler method for getting quater from a given date

* Specified the result path (where the resulting table would be)

* Converted XLSX to JSON using a custom built module (internally using xlsx javascript module)

* Iterated over the products, years and quaters of the transactions to:
	> get total amount
	> get total quantity
	> calculate average price

* Created a JSON result using results gotten from the iteration

* Filtered result to remove rows without average price values (Some products don't exist in some quaters of the some years).

* Used the custom module created in Test 1 to convert the filtered JSON data to CSV file (so the result is a CSV table)
