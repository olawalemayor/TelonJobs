-----Test 2b-----

* The programming language used is Javascript (NodeJS)

* Specified the entry path for the files

* Specified the result path (where the resulting table would be)

* Converted XLSX to JSON using a custom built module (internally using xlsx javascript module)

* Iterated over the years of the transactions to:
	> get transaction for last year with the same quater
	> get transaction for last year on the 4th quater
	> set the resulting JSON to contain average price from the last year transaction
	> set the resulting JSON to contain average price from last year 4th quater
	> set the average prices to "Not applicable" when there is no average price for the last year or last year 4th quater

* Used the custom module created in Test 1 to convert the resulting JSON data to CSV file (so the result is a CSV table)
